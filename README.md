OpenAID: Blockchain-Based Unique Identity for AI Models

OpenAID is an open-source platform leveraging blockchain technology to provide unique, verifiable identities for AI models. It aims to establish a secure and transparent framework for managing AI models, ensuring trust, ownership attribution, and traceability throughout the lifecycle of a model.

Overview
AI has created challenges in managing model ownership, licensing, and provenance. OpenAID addresses these challenges by integrating open blockchain technologies to enable decentralized and transparent tracking of AI models.

Key Features:
Unique Identification: Each AI model is assigned a distinct, immutable ID recorded on a blockchain.
Ownership Attribution: OpenAID securely links AI models to their respective owners, providing an indisputable record of ownership.
Version Control: Tracks changes and updates to models, ensuring transparency and accountability in the evolution of AI systems.
Provenance and Verifiability: Provides a mechanism for verifying the authenticity and attributes of AI models using public, decentralized ledgers.
Compatibility with Open Blockchains: Designed to work seamlessly with open blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum and Polygon, enabling interoperability and broad accessibility.
Technology Stack

OpenAID will use the following technologies to achieve its goals:
Blockchain: Public blockchain networks like Ethereum or Layer 2 solutions for cost efficiency and scalability.
Smart Contracts: Custom contracts written in Solidity for managing model registration, updates, and verification.
Decentralized Storage: Solutions like IPFS for storing metadata and large files related to AI models.
Web Platform: A user-friendly interface for model registration, updates, and verification.

Objectives:
Promote Transparency: Establish a universally verifiable standard for AI model management.
Foster Trust: Ensure AI models can be traced to their origins, with clear ownership and licensing terms.
Simplify Model Lifecycle Management: Provide tools for easily tracking changes, updates, and transfers of AI models.
Enable Open Collaboration: Support compatibility with existing open-source AI frameworks and blockchain technologies.
